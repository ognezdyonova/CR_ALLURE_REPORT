Thus, there are two tasks involved both of which require attending, discriminating, and imitating. The goal is to build the basic repertoires necessary for imitating other people (especially other children) during play, social interactions, and academic activities. This type of imitation also begins to build the motor skills necessary for noun-verb listener behaviors (i.e., performing motor actions with objects on verbal command, for example, '\"spin the wheel'\").","number":6,"text":"Imitates 10 actions that require selecting a specific object from an array (e.g., selects a drumstick from an array also containing a horn and a bell, and imitates an adult\u2019s drumming). <b>(T)</b>","title":"","responses":[{"score":0.0,"text":"Score 0 Points","description":""},{"score":0.5,"text":"Score 1/2 Point","description":"Give the child \u00BD point if he imitates 5 different actions with an object selected from an array of 3 when prompted, '\"Do this.'\""},{"score":1.0,"text":"Score 1 Point","description":"Give the child 1 point if he imitates 10 different actions with an object selected from an array of 3 when prompted, '\"Do this.'\""}],"level":2,"skills":[{"id":"6-a","supporting":false,"skill":"Imitates blowing 2 times (e.g., bubbles, candles, balloons) <b>(T)</b>"},{"id":"6-b","supporting":false,"skill":"Imitates 5 common gestures (e.g., shrugging shoulders, thumbs up, finger to closed lips) <b>(E)</b>"},{"id":"6-c","supporting":false,"skill":"Imitates turning a page in a book <b>(T)</b>"},{"id":"6-d","supporting":false,"skill":"Imitates 5 actions with a specific object selected from an array of 2 (e.g., imitates hugging puppy from an array of a doll and a puppy) <b>(T)</b>"},{"id":"6-e","supporting":false,"skill":"Imitates pulling 5 different items apart (e.g., Duplos, Kid K\u2019Nex, lids on containers) <b>(T)</b>"}]},{"definition":"Imitates 20 different fine motor actions when prompted, Do this (e.g., wiggling fingers, pinching, making a fist, making a butterfly). <b>(T)</b>","example":"Claw fingers, pointing at items, wiggle index finger, clasp hands, touch fingertips, hold up the number 2, pretend walking on two fingers, wiggle rabbit     ears, making letters from fingerspelling, making signs from sign language.","materials":"A list of possible fine motor imitative behaviors.","objective":"To determine if the child\u2019s fine motor imitative behavior is becoming stronger and generalized.","number":7,"text":"Imitates 20 different fine motor actions when prompted, Do this (e.g., wiggling fingers, pinching, making a fist, making a butterfly). <b>(T)</b>","title":"","responses":[{"score":0.0,"text":"Score 0 Points","description":""},{"score":0.5,"text":"Score 1/2 Point","description":"Give the child \u00BD point if he imitates 10 different fine motor actions when prompted, '\"Do this.'\""},{"score":1.0,"text":"Score 1 Point","description":"Give the child 1 point if he imitates 20 different fine motor actions when prompted, '\"Do this.'\""}],"level":2,"skills":[{"id":"7-a","supporting":true,"skill":"Imitates 3 play behaviors in the natural environment (e.g., pushing a car down a ramp) <b>(T)</b>"},{"id":"7-b","supporting":false,"skill":"Imitates 5 two-step behaviors (e.g., touch head and touch shoulders) <b>(E)</b>"},{"id":"7-c","supporting":true,"skill":"Spontaneously imitates a behavior observed on a TV or video (e.g., dancing, hopping) <b>(O)</b>"},{"id":"7-d","supporting":true,"skill":"Imitates 5 facial expressions (e.g., kissing, opening mouth, shutting eyes, scrunching nose) <b>(T)</b>"},{"id":"7-e","supporting":true,"skill":"Maintains a newly acquired imitative behavior after 24 hours without training <b>(T)</b>"},{"id":"7-f","supporting":false,"skill":"Imitates a new behavior correctly on the first trial <b>(E)</b>"},{"id":"7-g","supporting":false,"skill":"Imitates 5 examples of finger play (e.g., pretend walking on two fingers, finger dancing) <b>(T)</b>"}]},{"definition":"Imitates 10 different three-component sequences of actions when prompted, Do this (e.g., clapping, jumping, touching toes; pick up a doll, place her in a crib, and rock the crib). <b>(T)</b>","example":"An adult taps his knees, shoulders, and tummy, and the child copies all three behaviors as one sequence of responding.
