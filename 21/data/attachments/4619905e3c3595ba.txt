This assessment program is based upon Applied Behavior Analysis with a focus on Skinner's (1957) analysis of verbal behavior. The VB-MAPP can help identify a student's strengths and weaknesses across a variety of critical skills. The assessment also makes it easy to compare and contrast the child's skills with those of typically developing children. %STUDENT_FIRST_NAME%'s performance in each of the domains tested will be presented, followed by an analysis of barriers that are affecting %STUDENT_FIRST_NAME%'s ability to learn.

Mands are spontaneous, frequent, and clearly controlled by the child's personal motivators, especially MOs that relate to verbal information (i.e., asking questions). These mands are constantly changing and very little formal training is necessary to develop new mands, in fact the problem at this age is often that a child has too many mands (\"the terrible two's\"). Echoic and imitation skills are well established, which makes teaching new words and skills easier. The visual perceptual and matching skills demonstrate more abstract thinking and are beginning to help pave the way for a variety of social and academic skills.

The primary goal is to eliminate the prompts that give away the response form (physical, echoic, and imitative prompts) or intraverbal prompts of the response form (i.e., saying the spoken word for children who are using sign language). The attempt to fade out the desired item too quickly may result in an impaired mand repertoire for some children.

This represents a significant milestone for a developing mand repertoire. These skills should be expanded on, and generalized to different people and materials, while being worked into as many natural environment settings as possible. In addition, spontaneous responses that occur without a verbal prompt such as, \"What do you need?\" should be differentially reinforced. The next step should involve teaching the child to mand for actions. Some children may already mand for some actions if the MO is strong (e.g., \"push\" while on a swing). Training should now include adult actions needed to complete a specific chain of behavior (similar to manding for objects). For example, if a child is making an art project and can't get the glue to come out, he should hand the glue to the adult and mand \"squeeze,\" or \"help.\" It is important to note that the mand is totally dependent on the existence of an MO for a particular item or activity. Teachers and parents need to be able to identify if and when a child's MO for something is strong in order to conduct mand training (see Hall & Sundberg, 1987; Sundberg, 1993a, 2004 for more detail on capturing and contriving motivation). MOs can vary greatly in strength, and occur in all environments, especially a child's natural environment (as opposed to a formal teaching session); thus mand training is 24/7, and all those involved with the child need to be \"on the same page.\" It is not uncommon to see a mand repertoire lag behind tact and LD repertoires for children with autism or other developmental disabilities. There are a number of causes of this, but often it is due to the complexities of capturing and contriving MOs, and the fact that presenting discrete SDs is easier to do in structured teaching. Mand training needs to be conducted in all environments, and when the MO is at strength.

The natural environment and typical play and social activities are excellent for teaching new mands. In fact, it may be very difficult and forced to teach this type of manding in formal discrete training arrangements.

Other mand activities can include mands to remove aversives (e.g., \"stop it\") and mands involving \"yes\" and \"no.\" Mands that contain gestures should also be reinforced, such as the child holding his palms up and open when manding for information (e.g., \"Where's mommy?\"), or emitting an outstretched arm along with \"Stop!\" Mands are dependent on a child's existing MO.

Sometimes intervention is more about reducing the frequency of manding, or emitting more \"polite\" mands. The goal for a child with autism or other language delays is to establish a basic mand repertoire that will functionally allow the child to control the behavior of others with verbal behavior. The specific reinforcement of the mand will do that, and once it does, the mand can often develop further without intensive intervention. Also, as previously mentioned, the natural environment becomes the best teaching arrangement for further mand development. The primary focus at this point should be on manding for verbal information. This type of manding often presents problems for some children with autism because they are not strongly reinforced by verbal information. If that is the case, then procedures to contrive information as valuable reinforcers may be necessary (e.g., Endicott & Higbee, 2007; Sundberg, Loeb, Hale, & Eigenheer, 2002). Additional mand training activities can include the differential reinforcement of novel mands, mands containing different parts of speech, and mands that contain three or more words."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in manding is milestone 11","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_MAND_HIGHEST% == 11","Text":"The ability to mand for information has significant effects on a child's developing verbal repertoire. Typically developing children experience a \"language explosion\" between 2 and 3 years of age. It is common to attribute this verbal development to the child's high frequency of asking questions (e.g., Brown, Cazden, & Bellugi, 1969). Once a child begins asking for different information, it is important to reinforce this behavior, as well as to use this opportunity to expand the response beyond the original question (Hart & Risley, 1975). For example, if a child asks, \"Who is that?\" when a plumber comes to the door, the adult's response, \"He is a plumber who is here to fix the drain,\" can be followed by a discussion about what a plumber does, how water gets into the house, how the drain might have become plugged-up, demonstrations of water going through pipes, and watching the plumber work, etc. After the plumber leaves further intraverbal discussions are possible. These language expansion opportunities are excellent activities for developing intraverbal and other related behaviors, and they exemplify how a single MO (\"curiosity\" about the man coming to the door) can lead to the development of more advanced verbal behavior. These MOs, often occurring in a child's natural environment, should be captured as often as possible and used for the further development of a child's language skills. It also demonstrates what can be referred to as a \"verbal module\" where a particular topic (e.g., a plumber) can provide a context for mand, tact, intraverbal, and listener training on a thematically related topic. When there is an MO at strength for that topic the procedures can become much more effective. These types of exchanges should become a daily part of the child's program. Additional activities for developing a mand repertoire can be found in the corresponding sections of the VB-MAPP Mand Task Analysis."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in manding is milestone 12","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_MAND_HIGHEST% == 12","Text":"One distinction among the different types of motivation is between wanting certain things or events and NOT wanting certain things and events (mands to remove aversives). Typically developing children often quickly learn the power of \"No!\" as a mand. This mand often causes problems for parents and generally would not be recommended as an early mand to teach children who have minimal mands. Rather, it is recommended that learning to mand for desired items be the initial focus of an early intervention program, but at some point learning to mand to remove aversive events is a major part of a mand repertoire. Once this skill is acquired it should be monitored carefully because of the complexity of the repertoire and \"emotional\" variables involved. For example, when a child is experiencing an aversive motivator (e.g., another child takes a toy) the probability of negative behavior is high and the probability of appropriate behavior is often low. An effective mand repertoire is part of the solution, but also there are emotional variables that are often more complicated to control (e.g., anger). Teaching sharing, cooperation, turn taking, and general tolerance of others is an essential part of the child's social success. However, without an acceptable mand to remove an aversive, it will be difficult to decrease negative behavior that serves the same function. Once a child has a beginning repertoire of these mands, expansion and generalization to novel aversive situations becomes quite important, as do the other parts of controlling emotions (e.g., self-control). It may also be useful to teach the child appropriate gestures that often go along with mands to remove aversives such as shaking the head \"no,\" or wiggling a finger. Like with many of the positive MOs described previously, most of the aversive MOs are going to be occurring in the child's natural environment and the focus of the intervention program needs to be there."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in manding is milestone 13","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_MAND_HIGHEST% == 13","Text":"A child should be able to mand for anything he can tact if there is motivation for that item, action, or modifier of the item or action (e.g., \"Lift me up in the tree\"). Once a child's mands move beyond nouns and verbs and he begins to emit prepositions, adjectives, pronouns, and adverbs as mands, the natural contingencies (specific reinforcement) should maintain manding. At this stage in mand development many of a child's mands may be for social interactions (e.g., \"Let's play dress up.\"), attention to their own intraverbal behavior (e.g., \"I want to tell the story.\"), mands to engage others in a variety of activities (e.g., games, play, and help with problems), and more complex mands for information (e.g., \"when,\" \"how,\" and \"why\").

Mands have such a unique and powerful type of consequence that usually little is necessary to maintain them. If anything, the focus may be on teaching the child to be more independent and on reducing these types of mands as some children become too \"bossy.\" As children grow, mands should always be changing because MOs change during a child's development. For example, mands for others to attend to the content of a child's intraverbal behavior (i.e., what he is talking about) becomes more important to the child as his intraverbal behavior becomes more complex. For example, when a child tells his parents about a problem he had with another child, he may be manding for sympathy, help, suggestions, advise, etc., and it is important that the adult attends to the details of his problem (e.g., \"What do I do?\"). It is important to monitor this to ensure that MOs are actually the source of control for manding (watch out for rote mands)."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in manding is milestone 15","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_MAND_HIGHEST% == 15","Text":"At this point the child should be demonstrating a mand repertoire commensurate with that of a typically developing 4-year-old child.

The size of the tact repertoire should also be the target of the intervention program. Typically, tact training for nouns can be conducted most efficiently in an intensive teaching format. Training in the natural environment is also valuable, but at this early tact level, tabletop training can allow for more careful use of correction procedures, prompting, fading, differential reinforcement, interspersal techniques (\"mixed VB\"), and other aspects of behavioral teaching procedures. It is also important to include training trials on LD types of tasks as well. In most cases with nouns, it is best to teach both the tact and LD skills simultaneously. In addition, training on tacting verbs should be included in the daily intervention program. Adults should avoid the temptation to formally teach tacts for other parts of speech such as adjectives, pronouns, prepositions, adverbs, etc. The majority of a typical child's verbal behavior at this level consists of nouns and verbs, and lots of mands (as well as echoic and imitative behaviors).

Additional tacting activities might consist of tacts of auditory stimuli; tacts involving the other sensory stimuli; tacts from books, scenes, and the natural environment; and tacts of body parts, people, and other common stimuli.

In day-to-day discourse it is common to talk about things that are present in a variety of different ways. Some of the ways that things are talked about make certain aspects of the physical world more salient, and a child must learn to attend to both verbal and nonverbal stimuli simultaneously in order to verbally respond correctly. Connecting the multiple words that people say with the multiple things and events that they talk about in the immediate environment constitutes a conditional discrimination where one stimulus changes the effects of another stimulus. For example, while reading a Curious George story to a child, an adult might ask the child, \"What color is George's hat?\" In order for the child to correctly respond, he must attend to George and the color of his hat and tact that color. If the verbal stimulus is changed to, \"What shape is George's hat?\" he must now tact the shape of the hat, rather than its color. The words \"color\" and \"shape\" change what aspects of the hat that the child should attend to. These words demonstrate intraverbal control, and the nonverbal stimuli related to the actual shape and color of the hat demonstrates tact control (e.g., the word \"color\" along with the actual color controls \"black\" and the word \"shape\" along with the actual shape controls \"round\"). Thus, this type of verbal behavior is part intraverbal and part tact (i.e., it is multiply controlled), and it is quite common in more advanced verbal interactions. This part-tact and part-intraverbal arrangement can become quite complicated. What if the picture contains three different characters with three different hats, holding three different boxes that all have different shapes and different colors? The words \"color,\" \"shape,\" \"hat,\" \"box,\" \"George,\" \"Fred,\" etc., must all have stimulus control, but stimulus control over what? It depends on what is on the page that the child is looking at in the book. The word \"color\" should evoke attending to the color of the next noun spoken (rather than its shape). The word \"hat\" should evoke attending to the hat (rather than the shirt or the box), and the word \"George\" should evoke attending to George (rather than Fred). This combination of verbal and nonverbal stimuli could easily result in dozens of correct responses to the exact same picture. The true test of this skill is the ability to respond to these arrangements when the verbal and nonverbal stimuli are presented in a mixed order (e.g., \"What color are George's shoes?\" \"What shape is Fred's box?\"). This is important because these mixed conditions more closely resemble the conditions that a child will face in his day-to-day social and academic environment. A child who scores at this level of tacting should have opportunities to make these types of discriminations in a wide variety of contexts, especially those occurring in the natural environment and during age-appropriate activities (i.e., generalization and functional use). For example, arts and crafts, games, outings, social events, etc., can all provide constantly changing nonverbal stimuli and should be accompanied by constantly changing verbal stimuli. This activity can help offset the strong tendency to become a rote responder (a common barrier for many children with autism at this point in language development). It is suggested that these skills become strong at the noun, verb, function, shape, and color level before other modifiers such as adjectives, prepositions, pronouns, and adverbs are added to the language curriculum. However, these individual tacts (e.g., \"in,\" \"on,\" \"big,\" \"little,\" \"fast,\" \"slow\") should become the focus (i.e., teaching the discrimination between \"big\" and \"little\" comparisons in a formal teaching arrangement).

As with all newly acquired verbal skills, there should be a focus on generalization and the functional use of the skills in a wide variety of daily activities. Once the individual discriminations are acquired, they can be inserted into more complex discriminations such as those described in Tact Level 3-11. For example, once a child learns to tact \"in\" and \"out,\" they can be asked intraverbal-tact questions in the visual context of a farm such as, \"What animal is on the fence?\" \"Where is the cow?\" \"Which animal is on the barn?\" \"Where is the chicken?\" (Note that these procedures can first be conducted in an LD or an LRFFC format.)"},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in tact is milestone 13","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_TACT_HIGHEST% == 13","Text":"Tacting relative adjectives requires that the child be able to discriminate among the different properties of objects when those properties are compared to each other.

These are hard discriminations for young children to make. Adverbs are also complex because they usually modify an action in some way. Both adjectives and adverbs are generally dependent on an existing noun and verb repertoire respectively, which is why most typically developing children have a well-established noun and verb repertoire before they acquire and appropriately use adjectives and adverbs. Once a child learns various adjectives and adverbs they should be inserted into a variety of noun and verb phrases that involve different verbal and nonverbal contexts in order to establish generalization and the functional use of these descriptors.

Much of their intraverbal behavior, however, is dependent on their tacts. That is, children talk about things that they can tact. For example, if a child goes to a novel event such as a Renaissance Faire and watches a jousting match, and learns to tact the knights, shields, swords, jousting poles, etc., he is then in a better position to tell others about what he saw. Thus, tacting is often viewed as a major cornerstone in language development. However, as is the theme in Skinner's analysis, a complete verbal repertoire requires that the response acquired as a tact also be available to the speaker as a mand and an intraverbal, given the appropriate antecedent variables. Procedures to move known tacts to intraverbal and mand conditions should be ongoing, but intraverbal activities may become a bigger focus as a child more quickly and easily acquires new tacts.

However, there are several different verbal and nonverbal repertoires that involve colors and shapes (e.g., tacts, mands, intraverbals), and credit for \"knowing colors\" or \"knowing shapes\" should not be given to a child who simply can touch a specific color or shape when asked to do so. A theme for the whole VB-MAPP assessment is that the same word can occur in all the verbal and nonverbal operants, and in increasingly complex arrangements. Demonstration of one skill at one level does not guarantee that the child has learned the other skills. For example, a child may be able to touch red when given an array of three different colored blocks, but errors may occur when asked to touch the red shirt while given an array containing a red shirt, red car, blue shirt, blue hat, red ball, and a green shirt. Obviously, this is a harder task (two-component), but one might be surprised when it is stated that a child \"knows colors\" and \"knows shapes\" but fails this test. One explanation for this error is that most adjectives modify nouns and the learner must be able to identify a particular property (adjective) of an item regardless of the specific item (noun). Adjectives are of less (or little) value without their noun-modifying function. When adjectives, like colors and shapes, are taught as single responses (without abstraction from a noun) it becomes more like a noun than an adjective. Once a child is able to successfully abstract color and shape (often the easiest of adjectives) from objects, multiple opportunities for generalization and functional use should be provided. For example, when getting dressed in the morning a parent might say to her child, \"How about wearing the red socks today?\" \"Can you get the red socks?\" Adding new adjectives should also be the focus of the intervention (e.g., broken, dirty, striped, silly, or noisy), but they should be introduced along with a variety of nouns (multiple exemplar training). Other parts of speech should also be included in formal listener training, such as prepositions, pronouns, and adverbs. It is important to keep in mind that these other parts of speech are also considered modifiers of nouns and verbs, thus they should be taught in conjunction with a variety of nouns and verbs.

As with all the milestones, they are only makers along the road, they are not the end of the road. One should be able to place any item behind any other item (e.g., \"Put the cow behind the fence.\"), or perform an action behind an item (e.g., \"Bounce the ball behind the garage.\"). In addition, the child must be able to discriminate \"behind\" from other locations (e.g., next to, in front of, near, or far) with the same items and actions. This is where generalization, functional use, multiple exemplar training, expansion, and other behavioral procedures are essential for reaching the goal of establishing a verbal repertoire that matches that of typically developing peers, and these extended activities should be the focus of the intervention for the further development of these listener skills.

Initially, this visual field might consist of a few pictures or objects on a table, but eventually the target visual field is the natural environment or representations of that environment in videos, picture scenes, or books. The simplest way to develop visual scanning skills is when the child has a visual sample to match with the target item in the natural array. Eventually, the sample stimulus will not be there and the child might be asked to find the same target item in the same natural array, but under the control of a verbal (i.e., LDs and LRFFCs) rather than a visual stimulus. Thus, not only can matching-to-sample teach a child that things go together and how to sort and categorize things, but how to look for and find things when they are not right in front of the child. A child who meets the current milestone is demonstrating the ability to visually associate physical items in his environment. This is an important skill that will be of value to the child in many ways as he develops. The focus now should be on increasing the number of items matched and increasing the array size and complexity. One important goal of VP-MTS training is to teach a child to scan, or look carefully at the physical (nonverbal) world. One way to do this is to begin to use arrays that contain similar stimuli (e.g., matching a spoon to a spoon in an array that also contains a knife and a fork).

For example, if the child can find the hammer on a table after being shown a picture of a hammer, the task can be made more difficult by showing a silhouette (instead of a picture) of a hammer, and moving the real hammer to a messy toolbox that contains a number of different tools. This specific task allows the child to carry the sample stimulus with him in that he can hold the picture and has it when he reaches the toolbox. Eventually, the picture can be removed and the SD is transferred to a verbal SD such as, \"Can you help me find a hammer?\" (an LD task now). This is clearly a more complicated task.

Children who engage in pretend play typically act out and vocalize their own scripts, whether they pretend to serve food or have a battle with action figures, children tend to vocalize, use gestures, and become very imaginative during pretend play.

A child who reaches the current milestone is demonstrating that his play behavior is being automatically shaped by its consequences. The barrier for some children is that hitting a ball further or making a successful basketball shot may not be a reinforcer for them, which is why contrived reinforcers are often necessary to reach this point. An analogy could be made to learning to read. Contrived reinforcers and careful teaching are necessary to teach a child the basics of reading in order for him to eventually be automatically reinforced by reading an entertaining book (e.g., Harry Potter). At this point in the intervention, contrived reinforcement may still be necessary for new activities (just like with typically developing children), and the child should be provided with opportunities to try a variety of physical activities.

That is, a child emits a behavior because the peer emits a behavior. Three simple forms of stimulus control at this point consist of motor imitation (e.g., pouring sand in a similar fashion of a peer), echoic behavior (e.g., repeating the vocal behavior of a peer), and chasing or following a peer. Procedures for prompting and differentially reinforcing these behaviors should be the focus of the intervention at this point.

Social games (e.g., hide and seek, Ring Around the Rosie) also are good vehicles for teaching children to initiate social interactions. The first types of verbal initiations are usually mands or mand-tact combinations (e.g., \"Ice cream truck!\"). Procedures to teach these mands involve giving the reinforcers that are valuable to the target child to the peer, and prompting the target child to mand to the peer."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in social skill is milestone 6","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_SOCIAL_HIGHEST% == 6","Text":"A child who attends to peers, imitates peers, and wants to interact with peers, but does not have the necessary verbal skills, may engage in negative behavior as a form of social interaction. It is important at this point in social development to place a focus on teaching simple verbal interactions between the target child and peers. Successful interactions with peers can also decrease the likelihood of social anxiety and withdrawal. The most functional type of early verbal behavior between children is manding. Tacts and intraverbals are important, but are more complex and come later. The child must learn four types of mand-related behaviors, two as a speaker and two as a listener. As a speaker the child needs to learn to (1) mand to a peer to obtain a reinforcer (e.g., a second person on a teeter-totter), and (2) mand to a peer to remove an aversive (e.g., not taking turns on a swing). As a listener a child must learn to (3) respond to the mands of a peer to deliver a reinforcer (e.g., get on the teeter-totter), and (4) respond to the mand of a peer to remove an aversive (e.g., get off the swing). These are complicated behaviors because they, like all mands, are controlled by motivational variables and may be complicated to identify and control. Even more complex is teaching a child to emit the socially correct behavior when the MO is strong (e.g., not to hit to get a turn on the swing, or to passively surrender a reinforcer to a peer). The easiest of these four different mand relations to teach a child is to mand for a desirable item from a peer. This often must be taught in a contrived situation, but can be easily accomplished using a manding to peers procedure. It is important when teaching this behavior to fade out adult prompting (e.g., \"Ask Joe for the gummy bear\") and reinforcement (e.g., \"Nice sharing!\"), because the goal is for the social behavior to come under the antecedent and consequential control of the peer, not the adult. Spontaneous manding to peers will be difficult to achieve if adults continue to control the social contingencies.

Responding to a peer's mand can be easy for some children, but quite difficult for others. The task is to teach the child to attend to the peer's mand (e.g., \"push me\") and emit a nonverbal response to that mand (e.g., pushing the peer in a wagon) without adult prompting. This behavioral repertoire is more complicated than it might seem. The target child may not want to push the peer, understand the peer's mand, know how to push the peer, be focused on getting the wagon himself, or be focused on some other activity. Training may be slower than teaching a target child to mand to the peer because the target child gets something from it, which is not always the case when he responds to the mands of others (e.g., even adults often fail to reinforce those who respond to their mands). Manding to remove aversives and responding to a peer's mand to stop a behavior, or return an item, are also more complicated, but are essential components of effective social interaction. Much of what is identified as \"turn taking\" and \"sharing\" involve these basic elements of the mand, as well as other skills identified in the VBMAPP Social Behavior and Social Play Task Analysis.

Once a peer becomes a conditioned reinforcer, imitating his behavior becomes fun for the child and new behaviors are learned this way. Wanting to be with other children can be a fragile process, and even many typically developing children have trouble with successful social interaction because of the many complicated variables involved (i.e., the complex verbal, nonverbal, and listener skills that form the basis of effective social interaction). If a child is successful at manding for reinforcers from peers, this increases the probability that the target child will \"invite\" the peer to join an activity, hang out with him, or cooperate in some other social game or interaction.

It demonstrates that the necessary motivating variables for social interaction are operative, and are effective in evoking behaviors that can lead to further emotional and social development. Verbal behavior is an essential component of social behavior, and any opportunity to encourage children to verbally interact during social play should be taken. Once children are imitating and manding to each other, additional types of verbal interactions can be developed through social play. Narrating play activities is a type of tacting, but it may have mand and intraverbal elements as well; it is thus a complicated form of behavior that will only begin to emerge at this point, but should nevertheless be encouraged. For example, a child says, \"I'm shooting webs from my hand like Spiderman\" (a type of tact, but also a mand for attention). The second child may respond \"Me too. Look out!\" (an intraverbal and a mand). Thus, this forms the beginning of verbal exchanges on a single topic, and represents a very healthy type of social behavior. The more time that the target child spends in verbal and nonverbal interaction with peers, the higher the probability that social behavior will become more comfortable and productive for the child. A focus on cooperation to achieve a result, sharing responsibilities, turn taking, and verbal interactions using mands for information and intraverbal responses between children, will be an important component of the program at this point."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in social skill is milestone 11","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_SOCIAL_HIGHEST% == 11","Text":"Children often develop prosocial relationships with other children because they discover that under many circumstances they need other children (\"Two heads are better than one\" as the adage goes). Meeting the current milestone suggests that the child is beginning to come in contact with the benefits of cooperating with other children. However, as with all the milestones, they are simply markers on the way to a greater goal. There is much more work to be done to firmly establish a child's skills in social cooperation. Social cooperation is not just one set of skills, or one collection of behaviors, but covers a wide variety of many different arrangements of social contingences. Along with needing two people to accomplish a desired goal, there are many other skills and activities where cooperation constitutes a core component, such as turn taking, sharing, problem solving, games, team activities, sports, leadership, delay of self-gratification, and restraint from negative behaviors in social play. It may be necessary to formally teach social skills using roleplaying but once the basic skills are acquired the child should be provided with supervised opportunities to transfer these skills to interactions with peers. It often takes years for typically developing children to acquire effective cooperative and social skills. For a child who reaches the current milestone, the focus should be on providing daily opportunities to generalize and expand prosocial behaviors. Additional activities that would be appropriate for a child scoring at this level can be found in the corresponding sections of the VBMAPP Social Behavior and Social Play Task Analysis. In addition, there are a number of programs available for teaching cooperative social behaviors, as well as other supporting social play behaviors, to children with autism and other developmental disabilites (e.g., Attwood, 1998; Baker, 2003; Bellini, 2006; Krempa & McKinnon, 2005; Leaf & McEachin, 1999; Taylor & Jasper, 2001; Weiss & Harris, 2001; Wolfberg, 1999)."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in social skill is milestone 12","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_SOCIAL_HIGHEST% == 12","Text":"In order to mand to a peer for information there must be an MO at strength for obtaining some specific verbal information from the peer. It is important to ensure that the MO is the source of control for the question (i.e., the child really wants to know the answer to the specific question). Once a child begins to demonstrate this type of manding to peers, often the natural consequences will maintain and expand the behavior. That is, getting specific verbal information from peers, such as the location of a toy or how it works, will naturally reinforce question asking, and may lead to asking other questions. The focus of the intervention at this point should be to encourage the expansion of question asking to a variety of motivators that might be related to other types of questions (e.g., \"who,\" \"what,\" \"where,\" \"when,\" \"which,\" \"why,\" \"how,\" \"can,\" \"do,\" \"will\"). Generalization to new situations, new peers, new settings, and new social contexts is also an important component of the development of a solid manding for information repertoire. There is another feature of this type of mand that plays a critical role in social development. A significant component of a \"conversation\" consists of manding for information. For example, one child might ask another child \"What video game do you have?\" The second child might then intraverbally respond to the question with \"Mario,\" which in turn creates a new MO for more information and evokes \"Which Mario?' which evokes \"Mario 3,\" and so. Conversations may also consist of many other forms of verbal and nonverbal behavior (echoics, tacts, LDs, LRFFCs, eye contact, gestures, etc.), but mands and intraverbals serve as the cornerstones of most conversations. Thus, it is important at this time to also focus on teaching a child to intraverbally respond to the mands from peers, and on teaching responses that sound natural and typical to their peers. Fluency training can help in the success of this particular skill. The child needs to be able to respond fairly quickly to the verbal statements made by peers.

Many important skills come together with this seemingly simple task. Consider that two of the most significant diagnostic criteria for autism consist of language delays and social impairment. Within the domain of language skills, intraverbal skills tend to be the biggest challenge for children with autism (as well as those with other developmental disabilities). It is common for many children with autism to acquire rudimentary intraverbal responses that are rote, out of context, or in other ways quite different from the types of intraverbal behavior acquired by typically developing peers. For a child who has acquired a successful intraverbal repertoire, the transfer to verbal stimuli presented by peers addresses the second component of the current milestone. Peers often emit unpredictable verbal stimuli, which often differ drastically from the standard intraverbal tasks presented by an adult. In addition, the peer's verbal stimuli are usually emitted with different words in different contexts; and with different syntax, grammar, prosody, etc. When a child has successfully responded intraverbally to these types of verbal stimuli, one of the hardest steps in generalization has occurred. The focus of the intervention at this point is to continue to generalize and expand these repertoires by providing varied contexts and opportunities for intraverbal responding to peers.

Contact with peers who demonstrate this type of play behavior should be fostered. Even if the target child is not the \"inventor\" or leader of the game, or if the child is not verbal during the game, the primary goal at this point is simply participation in the game or activity. This type of play often results in the child learning without direct adult teaching, and helps to develop play and social concepts by listening, observing, and imitating. As participation increases, reinforcement should be provided for individual creative behaviors, verbal behaviors, extensions, generalization (e.g., to other peers or siblings), or other targets that involve unscripted, creative, and imaginative social behaviors.

For many children, acting like others becomes automatically reinforcing. In fact, the establishment of automatic reinforcement is one of the primary goals in developing both motor and vocal imitation. The reinforcers that maintain echoic and imitative behavior should gradually shift from contrived reinforcers to natural and automatic reinforcers, like in typical child development. Initially children may need to be taught to imitate others, but eventually children imitate others because the behavior itself automatically produces reinforcers. This becomes very obvious when children spontaneously imitate adults (e.g., talking on a phone, brushing their own hair, or putting a doll in a crib). It is fun to act like mom or dad, sound like a movie or TV character, or follow peers. Imitation also often results in natural or non-contrived reinforcers in play or social activities, such as when a \"thumbs up\" evokes a reciprocal \"thumbs up\" and reinforcement occurs from the other person.

One is to develop more advanced listener skills, which can be accomplished in a variety of ways through LRFFC, and the second is to facilitate the development of intraverbal behavior. For a child who scores at this level on LRFFC, the focus of the LRFFC intervention program should be on listener skills, rather than on intraverbal skills (this will come a little later). A goal of LRFFC listener training is to teach a child to correctly respond to increasingly more complex verbal stimuli in a systematic way. The first level of complexity beyond standard listener discrimination (LD) training is that LRFFC skills are based in part on the premise that people frequently refer to items and events in the environment without directly naming them, but rather by describing them in one way or another. The classification of this description as the function, feature, and class is only a rough distinction (there certainly are other ways of describing things and events), but it does provide a general guideline for assessment and training. Another way that verbal stimuli become more complex is that there are more parts to the verbal statement (e.g., \"Find an animal that lives in the water and on land\"). And a third way is that the content becomes increasingly complex (e.g., everyday clothing versus the parts of a motor). These increasing levels of complexity are incorporated into the assessment program. Foods and drinks are identified as the first milestone in LRFFC assessment because of the powerful motivation often associated with these items, and a child's frequent exposure to the words \"eat\" and \"drink.\" Other less motivating classifications typically don't occur until later in verbal development. The next step for a child who can select foods and drinks without an adult naming them, but identifying them by their class, is to move to fill-in statements that involve verbs or functions and common nouns. In order to be successful at this task it is imperative that the child already be able to identify the verbs and nouns (as tacts and LDs), as well as verb-noun (or noun- verb) combinations. For example, if a child cannot tact and LD an object spinning, it will be hard for him to learn (in a non-rote manner) to select a top in an LRFFC task (when asked, \"you spin a....\"). For some children with strong LD repertoires and weak tact repertoires, they may be successful at these types of LRFFC tasks, but it is important to not let the listener repertoire get too far ahead of the speaker repertoire. Thus, the focus of the intervention at this point should be on teaching the child to identify the items that they already know as tacts and LDs, but with different and more complex verbal stimuli. A variety of specific activities and a sequence for more advanced skills can be found in the VB-MAPP LRFFC Skills Task Analysis."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in LRFFC is milestone 7","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_LRFFC_HIGHEST% == 7","Text":"A child who scores at this level is just beginning to develop more advanced listener skills. The focus at this point should be to (1) expand the repertoire by introducing new fill-in LRFFC relations (shoot for several hundred), (2) gradually move to the WH-question format, (3) generalize known items to variations of the items, (4) generalize to different people, (5) use new carrier phrases, (6) use different tones of voice, volume, prosody, etc., and (7) increase the size of the array. Perhaps most importantly, LRFFC training can teach a child to attend more carefully to complex verbal stimuli, a skill that will be very important for later intraverbal development. New items can continue to be introduced with fill-in statements, but they should be moved to WH questions as soon as possible, or to more natural statements that a child is likely to encounter (fill-ins do not occur much in natural discourse, and should be considered a prompt that needs to be faded at some point). For example, instead of saying, \"You ride in a...\" now say in a child friendly and playful voice, \"Hey Ryan, what are we going to ride in?\" (with perhaps an emphasis on \"ride in\" as a step in the fading process). LRFFC provides an excellent opportunity to develop verbal stimulus control, and can be a fun procedure to run in the natural environment. Known relations should be incorporated into play and social activities, group instruction, arts and crafts, and other classroom and home activities. Other WH questions such as \"where,\" \"which,\" and \"who\" can also be introduced at this point.

The teaching procedure known as multiple exemplar training where several different examples and non-examples of stimuli and responses are combined helps to establish concepts, advanced discriminations, and exclusion of incorrect or rote responses. For example, when a picture of a fire truck is presented in an array, a child should be able to select that fire truck given a wide variety of statements (e.g., \"Find a red vehicle.\" \"What does a fireman drive?\" \"What is used to put out fires?\"), but not select the fire truck when given other statements (e.g., \"What flies in the air,\" \"What floats on the water?\"). It is important that this skill is established across a variety of items and activities (e.g., animals, people, toys, clothing) to ensure that verbal stimulus and response generalization is occurring. Also, LRFFC nicely sets the stage for intraverbal development as described below. Previously, it was suggested that the second value of LRFFC was that it could facilitate intraverbal behavior. That's because the verbal stimulus in the LRFFC trial can be almost exactly the same verbal stimulus found in an intraverbal relation. For example, if the verbal stimulus in an LRFFC trial is, \"What do you draw with?\" and the child touches a crayon, this exact same verbal stimulus can occur in the intraverbal where instead of touching a crayon (a nonverbal response) the child says the word \"crayon\" (a verbal response). Many children will begin to spontaneously tact the target nonverbal stimulus in the array during an LRFFC trial. When this begins to happen, it is an excellent indicator that the child is ready for more extensive intraverbal training, and the LRFFC to intraverbal transfer procedure is likely to be effective. Specific LRFFC skills to work on at this point include selecting multiple members of a class (multiple exemplar training), fluency activities (timed responding with a focus on rapid responses), making more use of books and the natural environment, and moving into adjective-noun multiple component verbal stimuli."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in LRFFC is milestone 10","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_LRFFC_HIGHEST% == 10","Text":"A child who reaches this milestone is ready for more intensive intraverbal training. Regarding LRFFC development, the array and the verbal stimuli should continue to become more complex. The array should begin to contain stimuli that are similar by any one of several ways such as shape, color, size, function, class, or texture. The task is to begin to make it harder for the child to find the target item (like the \"Where's Waldo\" game). This activity strengthens attention and visual scanning, which plays a significant role in many aspects of human behavior (e.g., social behavior, sports, self-help, and vocational skills). The verbal stimuli should begin to contain more multiple parts, such as providing things with two or three features or functions that distinguish one choice from another. For example, \"Find a big animal that likes the water,\" versus \"Find a little animal that likes the water.\" Skills relating to the past and future can also be developed in an LRFFC format. For example, if a child saw a fire truck at school earlier, an LRFFC task could consist of presenting an array containing a fire truck and the question, \"What did you see at school today?\" Sequencing skills can also be developed in a similar manner. For example, an LRFFC trial can consist of presenting an array containing a towel and the verbal stimulus, \"After you take a bath what do you need?\" Finally, there should be a continued focus on generalization training in the natural environment; the introduction of new topics; and making the trials fun, natural, and relevant to the child."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in LRFFC is milestone 11","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_LRFFC_HIGHEST% == 11","Text":"A child who scores at this level is demonstrating a strong LRFFC repertoire, and the focus should be on more complex arrays from books and pictures that contain similar stimuli, complex scenes, stories, sequences, social events, or new places, etc. Pictures and books can offer a wealth of visual stimuli to use in training, often significantly more than is available in the child's natural environment. However, the natural environment should continue to play a major role in LRFFC activities, but training should be conducted in a manner that does not make trials look or feel like structured training. The verbal stimuli should continue to increase in complexity by including more adjectives that require the child to attend to the properties of items more carefully. Asking the child to \"find a big animal\" requires the child to attend to both the size and the class of all the options in an array, and make multiple discriminations for a single selection response (e.g., selecting an elephant). As always, it is important to ensure that the components of these skills are already strong in the child's repertoire before they are combined in this manner (i.e., he can at least LD \"big\" and \"little,\" and emit correct LRFFC tasks involving \"animals\").

Also, the arrays used should now be almost exclusively from scenes, books, or the natural environment (except for teaching new complex discriminations such as WH rotation questions). Not only will this training strengthen a child's listener skills, but it provides a foundation for eventual intraverbal skills where a child is able to, for example, talk about a story from a book well after the book has been put away.

While LRFFC activities are important, the focus on them as a formal listener training activity should be gradually replaced by using LRFFC for more intensive intraverbal training. LRFFC activities of some types will always occur, but what becomes more important is that a child be able to talk about events and activities when those events and activities are no longer present, and that's intraverbal behavior. LRFFC trials can be a good step toward developing verbal conditional discriminations and teaching intraverbal behavior, and at this point they should occur in a child's natural environment, as opposed to tabletop tasks.

For example \"Can you name a hot food?\" versus \"Can you name a cold food?\" While the word \"food\" is the same in each question, the words \"hot\" and \"cold\" change the correct answer, and require that the child attend more carefully to the individual components of a sentence. In addition to these activities, training on \"what\" questions involving the function of things would also be appropriate at this time (e.g., \"What do you do with a hose?\")."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores  1 point in INTRAVERBAL is milestone 11","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_INTRAVERBAL_HIGHEST% == 11","Text":"Of all the different verbal operants presented in this program, the intraverbal repertoire presents the greatest challenge for developing a repertoire that matches that of typically developing peers. One important milestone in this road to intraverbal proficiency is spontaneous intraverbal behavior that is relevant to naturally occurring events in the child's life, and not prompted by additional adult behavior. A child who reaches this milestone will usually begin to acquire new intraverbal relations at a rapid pace, due to the functional nature of the repertoire. Specifically, effective intraverbal behavior usually gets reinforced in the natural environment. The focus for the child should now be on expanding the complexity of intraverbal stimuli and intraverbal responses. There is no single way to accomplish this, and thus a variety of teaching strategies and activities that contribute to intraverbal development are recommended (see the VBMAPP Intraverbal Task Analysis). Two important elements of increasing complexity consist of teaching the child to (1) respond to verbal stimuli that have multiple components, and (2) emit responses that have multiple components. For example, a verbal stimulus that has multiple components would be a WH question that contains nouns, verbs, and adjectives, etc., such as, \"What color is a fire truck?\" Technically, these involve verbal conditional discriminations (VCDs) where one word changes the meaning of the next word, and thus changes the correct answer. If the example had been, \"Who drives a fire truck?\" the response \"fireman\" rather than the response \"red\" would have been correct. This level of verbal discrimination is often difficult for children with language delays and must be taught carefully, and in a reasonable order of increasing complexity. The other element of increasing the complexity of intraverbal behavior involves establishing more complex response forms, that is, longer and more detailed sentences. The verbal responses children make should begin to contain combinations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives, etc. The potential combinations of intraverbal stimuli and responses will ultimately reach well into the thousands, and tens of thousands. Keep in mind that a significant component of the K-12 educational system is focused on developing intraverbal behavior (although usually not called that)."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in INTRAVERBAL is milestone 12","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_INTRAVERBAL_HIGHEST% == 12","Text":"Once a child's verbal behavior is clearly under verbal stimulus control, and occurs outside of a discrete trial teaching format and without adult prompting, the focus should be on more rapid expansion of the intraverbal content. The sources for new intraverbal content are endless. The dayto- day activities in a child's life provide numerous topics to talk about. Books, stories, videos, and other forms of entertainment can also provide a rich source of verbal stimuli that can be used to develop intraverbal behavior. The important element is that an adult uses these opportunities to prompt and expand intraverbal responding. Some of the techniques of incidental teaching (Hart & Risley, 1975) can be effective in getting children to talk more about things and events in their world. In general, at this point in the language intervention program there should be a significant focus on intraverbal behavior, more so than on acquiring new tacts or listener discriminations (LDs). While these verbal operants are important, a verbal repertoire that contains mostly tacts and LDs is highly restrictive in social and academic settings. While tacts and LDs are important foundations, functionally it would seem odd to walk around tacting (e.g., \"car,\" \"dog,\" \"brown house\"). Much of a child's language at this point in development involves talking about activities and things, rather than just naming them, or receptively identifying them."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in INTRAVERBAL is milestone 13","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_INTRAVERBAL_HIGHEST% == 13","Text":"The ability to attend to stories and respond to questions about the story is a common milestone that appears on many developmental charts. This is because the task involves several important linguistic skills, such as attending to verbal stimuli, comprehension, recall, and expansion of novel verbal content.

Again, intraverbal development is a monumental task that involves many different components of teaching and parenting. Of the suggestions for development on the VB-MAPP Intraverbal Task Analysis list, two warrant a special emphasis: stimulus generalization and response generalization. These two forms of generalization have been discussed previously, but it is critical to stress the importance of monitoring this development in children with language delays, especially those with autism. The intraverbal repertoire is highly susceptible to becoming rote. Even many typically developing individuals have defective intraverbal behavior in that they talk about the same topic in the same manner frequently. Intraverbal behavior must be flexible and generalized. Encourage generalization at every step of the way. A large intraverbal repertoire is of little value to a child if it is non-functional, rigid, not generalized, or prompt bound.

The behavior typically occurs in the absence of tact variables (e.g., the event that occurred is no longer present), and is free from echoic or other prompts. It also has a major social element to it that is quite important for development. Another important milestone is the ability to accurately answer multiple questions about a single topic. The questions may contain several components and require that the child attend carefully to each component. This skill provides the foundation for much of the academic training that a child might soon encounter. There are far too many intraverbal activities to list at this point. A child should be engaging in 100s, if not 1000s, of intraverbal interactions per day.

While all individuals continue to acquire new mands and tacts, there is somewhat of a limited number of these verbal relations relevant to a specific individual, relative to the potential number of different intraverbal relations. A typical adult has an intraverbal repertoire consisting of hundreds of thousands of intraverbal connections. Just reading the daily newspapers can evoke thousands of intraverbal responses. Thus, once a basic intraverbal repertoire is established for a child, it is important to continue to provide the child with new content, generalization opportunities, and increasingly complex stimuli while encouraging increasingly complex responses.

Also, a formal classroom routine and structure may be novel. A common pattern for many children new to a school setting is to cry (sometimes demonstrating separation anxiety), or in some other way express unhappiness with the new setting (e.g., standing by the door, tantruming, aggression, property destruction, or self-injurious behavior). For these children, providing reinforcement the minute the child is appropriate, pairing (comfort), opportunities to mand (if possible), stimulating activities, and lowered demands typically reduces the emotional or negative behavior. Generally, by the end of the first week or two most children are more comfortable in the new setting. Some children don't demonstrate any separation problems, and immediately begin exploring the new environment, interacting with interesting toys, and sometimes even the other children. However, they still may not sit for an extended period of time (3-5 minutes) and respond when told to do so. Any given child can fall between these two ends of the continuum, but the goal for all children with special needs is to not only be comfortable in the classroom, but to learn in that setting. All classrooms differ, but most operate with some kind of formal structure such as snack or lunchtime, group time, stations, activity centers, toileting, recess, and formal teaching sessions. Some children are able to immediately comply with classroom routines, but others may have difficulty giving up their freedom. These are often children who may have elevated scores on the barriers assessment, specifically instructional control and/or behavior problems. For some children, this may be a significant problem and a more thorough descriptive or functional analysis may be warranted along with a formal behavior intervention program. It is not uncommon for children with special needs to resist any imposed structure (e.g., bedtime, car seats, sit down meals, table activities, or any type of confinement). However, if a child is able to sit for 3 minutes at a snack table, but maybe not much longer, or not at a work station, group setting, or table task, the focus should be on establishing instructional control, including differential reinforcement of longer periods of staying in a seat. Demand should be kept low, the activities at the table or in the group should be fun, and contingent reinforcement for sitting carefully and systematically provided, while demand and amount of sitting time is gradually increased. The goal at this point is primarily establishing instructional control and compliance with classroom routines.

Once a child begins to comply with everyday classroom routines with minimal prompting, the focus can shift to other skills. For example, transitions from one activity to another are important, but initially may be difficult for some children because they may not have a history of going to a specific activity on command. In addition, transitions may require that a child give up a reinforcing activity (e.g., recess) for a less desirable one (e.g., tabletop tasks), or the child may become distracted transitioning between activities, and these contingencies must compete with the verbal instruction or independent transitioning.

A major goal for any child is to acquire the skills to move to a less restrictive teaching format. While many children benefit significantly from a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio, there comes a point where this instructional format throughout the whole day may not be in the best interest of the child. Perhaps the most obvious problem is that the adult acquires strong stimulus control over a child due to a long history of careful stimulus presentation and reinforcement delivery (even if several adults are involved, due to its very arrangement and success, the 1:1 format establishes strong stimulus control). The child's success within a 1:1 format may initially make it difficult for learning to respond in more typical adult-to-child social and educational ratios. These more typical situations may not involve ongoing prompts, errorless teaching, or careful reinforcement delivery. In addition, an over reliance on a 1:1 adult-child instruction format may hinder peer interactions because of the strong reinforcement history established with adults, and the lack of experience interacting with other children in a group. There are a variety of other potential problems associated with relying solely on a 1:1 teaching ratio, such as generalization, prompt and other forms of dependence, establishing new conditioned reinforcers, accepting change and variation, as well as difficulty with supervision and curriculum progression. While clearly many children need and greatly benefit from 1:1 instruction at a certain point in an educational and social program, group instruction can be quite valuable. Therefore, it is suggested that the focus at this point should be on developing a child's ability to learn within a group-teaching format. This activity should be part of the child's daily program, while  not necessarily giving up the 1:1 or 1:2 instructional format, but by including direct training of age appropriate social rules and social activities as part of the child's program. At this point the goal is to get the child to stay seated in a group format (3 or more children) and not engage in negative behaviors. Eventually, attending to the teacher and the material, as well as emitting appropriate verbal and nonverbal responses should also become target behaviors. Early group activities may have the feel of \"entertaining\" the child (e.g., arts and crafts, music, puppet shows, games) rather than teaching the child, but learning to sit in a group format is a critical skill that often must be taught, and is a prerequisite to learning more advanced skills in this educational format."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in group is milestone 9","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_GROUP_HIGHEST% == 9","Text":"Once a child will sit in a group without disruptive behaviors the focus can now be on increasing the time attending to the teacher and materials presented in the group, and responding to the teacher's questions and instructions.

The main goal at this point is simply to get the child to respond to the teacher in the group format, rather than teach new verbal or nonverbal behaviors. Sitting, attending, and responding should be reinforced at a level appropriate for the individual child.

Many morning circle groups contain a variety of short activities or topics, and may also follow a general theme of the day or week (e.g., holidays, caterpillars and butterflies, winter, farm animals). New tacts and LDs can be targeted for acquisition in the group format using the same basic prompt, fading, transfer, and differential reinforcement procedures used in 1:1 instruction. In addition, the instruction format should begin to include \"group SDs\" where the teacher's questions and instructions do not include an individual child's name or any clear indication that a specific child should respond (e.g., \"Who can tell me...\" \"Does anyone know...\" \"Everybody...\"). This will begin to teach the child to attend to these types of verbal stimuli, which are very different than the types of indirect adult prompts that are inherent in a 1:1 format (e.g., saying the child's name, sitting directly in front of the child, conducting all trials for one child, mild aversive control in the form of confinement or tone of voice, or similar daily teaching patterns, etc.). It may also be appropriate at this point to begin to increase the size of the group, which will naturally reduce the amount of prompts given to one child. There are many variations of group instruction formats that are common to preschools and elementary classrooms. \"Stations\" or \"centers\" involve small groups that might focus on a particular activity or component of a particular theme. Children rotate through the different activities in small groups of 3 or 4 each, while the instructional assistants or teachers stay at a particular station. For example, if the theme is fish, one station may contain an arts and crafts activity that involves cutting out and pasting fish. This activity can easily include new mands, tacts, intraverbals, and imitative behaviors. In addition, there can be a focus on differentially reinforcing independent work and/or peer interactions. A second station may involve reading a book about fish (e.g., Dr. Seuss's One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish). New verbal and nonverbal behaviors can also be taught in the group format with this material. A third station may involve a fishing game where children can use a magnetic fishing pole to catch fish in a pond. This presents lots of opportunities for verbal behavior, imitation, peer interactions, sharing, matching-to-sample, etc., set in a fun and age-appropriate instructional format.

However, once that match is unavailable (i.e., as in the mand, tact, and intraverbal) the quality of the articulation deteriorates for many early learners, and it often becomes difficult for listeners to understand what a child is saying. The current milestone is designed to be an early indicator of the quality of the child's articulation in the absence of an echoic prompt, as well as when the listener is out of contact with the item tacted. It is usually much harder to understand a word emitted by an early learner if one cannot see (or hear, touch, etc.) the referent, but this is the direction that a verbal repertoire must head in order for it to be of functional value for a child. This effect is easy to observe with an adult who can echo a language he does not know very well and be very close to the words of the language, but when the echoic prompt is gone, he may be a long way from the proper pronunciation. The ability for adults to understand a small set of tacts emitted by a child is a significant milestone for many children, but a further analysis of the individual child may be important for taking the next step (also see the section on articulation barriers). Avoid adding new words too quickly, especially those that rhyme with each other, contain alliteration, or difficult blends (a similar case can be made for the child learning sign language). It is common for the words to become increasingly more difficult to understand if new vocabulary words are added too fast. This is perhaps why the tact-test presented in this milestone should be an ongoing activity for the early learner who is having difficulty with articulation. In addition, the expertise of a speech and language pathologist can help keep vocal development on track. It is important to keep in mind the long process that is involved in the vocal development of typically developing children. Articulation practice begins with cooing and babbling (3-4 months of life), and continues on for several years. And despite the hundreds of thousands of \"practice\" sounds, words, and phrases emitted by most children over the first few years of life, it is still often hard for strangers to understand the articulation of many 3-year-old children.

In fact, some children acquire tacts first, and still fail to acquire listener discriminations. However, at this early stage, both skills should be developed simultaneously. If a child scores high on LDs, but low on tacts, there should be an increased focus on tact development, and vice versa. It is important to keep these two repertoires fairly close together in vocabulary size. The mistake is to consider listener skills to be cognitively similar to speaker skills. They are best viewed as separate behavioral repertoires, and a child should be able to demonstrate both.

Note that MLUs also vary between each of the verbal operants.

Skinner identifies this behavior as an example of autoclitic behavior (Skinner, 1957, ch. 12). Autoclitics consist of additional verbal responses that a speaker emits that modify in some way other words that the speaker emits. Thus, autoclitic behavior consists of verbal behavior about the speaker's own verbal behavior. For example, a child may say, \"Don't take that,\" or a child might scream, \"DON'T TAKE THAT!\" The scream reveals an emotional state (an MO) and is an autoclitic mand of strength that accompanies the primary mand in order to have a special effect on the listener (e.g., I mean REALLY don't take that). Prosody often involves these additional autoclitic responses and typically occurs without any special training. That is, once the primary mands, tact, and intraverbals are learned, children are differentially shaped into adding secondary autoclitics to what they say, due to their special effects on listeners (for more detail on the autoclitic see Peterson, 1978)."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in LINGUISTIC is milestone 10","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_LINGUISTICS_HIGHEST% == 10","Text":"A typically developing child has acquired several hundred verbal responses by 30 months of age.

However, individual vocabulary words can be mands, tacts, or intraverbals, and the ability to emit certain words as one verbal operant does not guarantee that those words will occur in another verbal operant. This makes the reliance on vocabulary size as a primary measure of language development somewhat deceptive and often misleading.

Nouns and verbs can be modified and combined in an almost infinite number of ways. Thus, prior to providing intensive teaching on words that modify a noun or verb (e.g., adjectives, prepositions, pronouns, adverbs, affixes), or words that combine nouns and verbs (e.g., conjunctions, disjunctions, articles, or affixes) it is essential that a child have a solid noun and verb repertoire. Inflections are one way that root words can be modified, and a child's correct emission of inflections represents a significant linguistic milestone. An inflectional affix \"conveys grammatical information\" about the root word (usually a noun or verb) to the listener. Nouns (and pronouns) have two types of inflectional markers: number and possession. A noun like \"dog\" can be inflected by an additional response that identifies how many dogs (number) and aspects of ownership or possession. In lay terms, is there more than one dog present, and what is \"owned\" by the dog(s)? In an analysis of a tact of plurality, for example, there are two nonverbal antecedent SDs, the dog and the number of dogs. The response \"dog\" is controlled by the type of animal seen, and the suffix \"s\" (or \"grammatical tag\") is controlled by the nonverbal SD of more than one dog. Thus, this type of verbal behavior represents a complex tact containing two separate antecedents and two separate responses (i.e., each response has a separate source of antecedent control). Plural and possession inflections occur in all verbal operants and listener skills (i.e., echoics, mands, tacts, intraverbals, LD, and LRFFC). Once a child is successfully emitting at least some plurals and possession tags correctly, it is important to make sure these verbal skills are generalized to a variety of nonverbal stimuli. For example, if a child can tact plurality for animals and toys, they may get credit for this milestone, but eventually it is essential that the child be able to tact plurality for any collection of nouns presented (e.g., spoons, books, and trees), and eventually use the correct emission of irregular plurals (e.g., geese, people, and feet). In addition, as mentioned above, teaching plurality for mands, tacts, and LDs is also essential. For example, in intraverbal plurality the verbal stimulus, \"What do you wear on your feet?\" should eventually evoke \"shoes,\" not \"shoe.\" This example of plurality demonstrates how traditional structural linguistics and Skinner's verbal behavior analysis each offer essential components of language assessment and intervention for children with language delays (i.e., form and function). Additional activities for developing various aspects of more complex grammatical skills can be found in the corresponding sections of the VB-MAPP Linguistic Structure Task Analysis."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in LINGUISTIC is milestone 12","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_LINGUISTICS_HIGHEST% == 12","Text":"Verbs can also be modified in a variety of ways, for example, by adding adverbs that tell where and how an action should be carried out (e.g., \"hide quick\"). Verbs can also be modified with inflections that provide time markers for when an action was carried out. There are three basic (or \"simple\") time markers: past, present, and future. An important milestone in linguistic development is the appropriate emission of these time markers with verbs. Most typically developing children acquire these inflections, along with many other grammatical conventions, without formal training, but rather through the process of automatic reinforcement and automatic shaping (Palmer, 1996). However, it is common for children with language delays to require formal instruction in order to correctly inflect verbs with time markers. Once a child is able to pass the current milestone the same issues described above for noun inflection are relevant. Specifically, there should be a focus on generalization and functional use of the inflection in all the different verbal operant and listener repertoires. In addition, verbs also have irregular forms (e.g., run and ran, break and broken, stand and stood) that often must be directly taught."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in LINGUISTIC is milestone 13","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_LINGUISTICS_HIGHEST% == 13","Text":"Noun phrases consist of a noun as the head of a larger grouping of other words. These words modify the noun in any of a number of ways. The most common modifiers are those that describe a property of the noun (adjective), the location of the noun in relation to other nouns (prepositions), or words that take the place of nouns (pronouns). Other modifiers (e.g., determiners) may limit a noun, such as articles (e.g., a, and, the) and demonstratives (e.g., this, that, these, and those). There are many additional modifiers in most languages and far more detailed classification systems (e.g., predeterminers and post determiners), but a description of them goes beyond the scope of this assessment and placement system.  As previously mentioned, a common measure in linguistics is the Mean Length of Utterance (MLU), which generally consist of the average number of morphemes (\"utterances with a specific meaning or grammatical function\") in a phrase or sentence. In contrast, this linguistic structure milestone focuses on whole words rather than individual morphemes in order to ensure that the major modifiers (adjectives, prepositions, etc.) are properly included in a noun phrase. Any individual noun phrase may actually contain 5-10, or more, individual morphemes. If a child's utterance appropriately contain two or more of the major modifies, the focus is again on generalization and use of the skills in the other language repertoires (i.e., mand, tact, LD). In addition, there should be a focus on the expansion of the utterance to include more modifiers and eventually connecting the noun phrase to a verb phrase (Linguistic Structure Level 3-15)."},{"Style":"Normal","Condition_Comment":"If the highest milestone the child scores 1 point in LINGUISTIC is milestone 14","Condition":"%ASSESSMENT_MILESTONE_LINGUISTICS_HIGHEST% == 14","Text":"Verb phrases consist of a verb as the head of a larger grouping of other words.

All of these types of verbs can include modifies (they tell the listener something more about the main action) such as adverbs, prepositions, and pronouns.

Pointing to words can teach the child that the story comes from the words, not the pictures. Adding expression to the words and making the story come alive can increase interest. Also, having the child follow along by making echoic responses while the adult points to words and reads can help to establish the words as SDs. Some children will begin to \"pretend to read\" by looking at the pictures and words and tell the story. For example, while looking at the Goodnight Moon book the child tells the story even though it does not correspond with the written print. These behaviors should be reinforced, and adults and others should read with the child as often as possible. Learning the names and sounds of individual letters is usually the next step. Often, a beginning step for children is singing the ABC song or completing ABC inset puzzles. There are at least eight different repertoires in early letter identification: (1) matching (MTS) letters to each other, (2) matching (MTS) uppercase letters to lowercase letters, (3) selecting (LD) a specific letter given the letter name, (4) selecting (LD) a specific letter given the letter sound, (5) providing the name (tact) of a printed letter (this could also involve intraverbal control as in \"What letter is this?\" versus \"What sound does this letter make?\"), (6) providing the sound (tact) of a printed letter (also part IV), (7) providing the letter name given only the sound (IV), and (8) providing the sound the letter makes given only the letter name (IV). Eventually, the child will need all of these skills for both uppercase and lowercase letters, but usually letter names come before letter sounds. In addition, some children will begin to recognize (tact and LD) whole words, and often those words are of special interest to the child (related to personal MOs) or frequently associated with a specific visual stimuli.
