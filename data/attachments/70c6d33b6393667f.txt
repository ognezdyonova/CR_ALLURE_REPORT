F. Skinner's groundbreaking analysis of human behavior (1953) and language (1957) has stood the test of time. Of the  many theories of human learning and language, Skinner's has led to the most effective methods for the assessment and  treatment of children and adults with autism or other intellectual disabilities. The application of Skinner's analysis  of verbal behavior (1957) to language assessment contained in the VB-MAPP represents the efforts of many people over  the past 50 years. Dr. Jack Michael has led the way as the consummate teacher of Skinner's analysis, and as the visionary  for its many applications. I thank Jack for being my teacher and mentor. </p> <p> Dr. Joseph Spradlin was the first to apply Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior to language assessment for the intellectually  disabled. He created the Parsons Language Sample (Spradlin, 1963) and inspired others to join him in his effort to use Skinner's  analysis for language assessment. The current program is firmly rooted in Dr. Spradlin's pioneering work.  </p> <p> The VB-MAPP spans a 40-year history of research and development. My first version of a verbal behavior assessment program  was developed at The Kalamazoo Valley Multihandicap Center (KVMC) during the 1970s, while I was one of Jack Michael's graduate  students at Western Michigan University. I would like to acknowledge the many staff members of KVMC who participated in the  over 50 verbal behavior research projects conducted at KVMC during that period. I would especially like to acknowledge my  co-authors on the 1979 version of the verbal behavior assessment and intervention program, David A. Ray, Dr. Steven J. Braam,  Mark W. Stafford, Thomas M. Rueber, and Dr. Cassandra Braam. I thank Dr. Jerry Shook, the former Director of KVMC, for his  help and support; Dr. Louise Kent for teaching me about language from a Speech Pathologist's point of view; and Dr. Norm  Peterson and Dr. Scott Wood who always left me with more to think about. I would also like to acknowledge Dr. A. Charles  Catania and Dr. Ernie Vargas for editing various versions of this material, and Dr. James W. Partington and Dr. Mary Ann  Powers for their contributions to the 1998 ABLLS version of the assessment program. Also, I would like to acknowledge the  staff members of the former STARS School for their research assistance and feedback through the years, and thank the children  and parents who have taught me many valuable lessons.  </p> <p> The VB-MAPP has benefited from the input of behavior analysts, speech pathologists, occupational therapists, special education  teachers, psychologists, and parents of children with special needs. I have appreciated their many suggestions for improvement  and hope they will be pleased with this content that they have helped to shape. I'd like to especially thank those who have  worked with me in public school classrooms during the last few years; Dr. Mary Ann Powers, Rikki Roden, Kaisa Weathers, Shannon  Rosenhan, Shannon Montano, and Eileen Cristobal-Rodriguez.  </p> <p> The VB-MAPP is conceptually a better learning, language, and social skills assessment program because of the valuable  field-testing and feedback from several groups in the United States and Canada. I'd like to thank Dr. Carl Sundberg, Michael  Miklos, Dr. William Galbraith, Dr. Anne Cummings, Dr. Rebecca Godfrey, and Brenda Terzich for sharing their time, resources,  and expertise. Also, I'd like to thank Lisa Hale, Cindy Sundberg, and Dr. Carl Sundberg for their field-testing with a wide  range of typically developing children. The results of this field-testing have provided important new information about various  aspects of language acquisition and social behavior.  </p> <p> I'd like to offer a special thanks to Dr. Barbara E. Esch, CCC-SLP, for her willingness to include her Early Echoic Skills  Assessment (EESA) as a subtest of the VB-MAPP, and for her many suggestions for the program as both a Speech and Language  Pathologist and a Behavior Analyst trained under Dr. Jack Michael.  </p> <p> The fields of behavior analysis, linguistics, and developmental psychology are filled with giants, many whose work is cited  throughout this guide. I would like to particularly acknowledge Dr. Douglas Greer for moving the application of verbal behavior  forward through his extensive research program at Columbia University Teachers College. I'd also like to acknowledge Dr. Vince  Carbone and Dr. Patrick McGreevy for the growth and interest in verbal behavior that has been generated by their work.  </p> <p> I thank Steve Payne and Patricia E. Young for skillfully and artistically transforming my VB-MAPP beta versions to the current  color-coded typeset version. I also want to thank my sons John and Dan for their help with the VB-MAPP. And last, but never  least, I thank my wife Cindy for her unwavering support and for her many contributions to the VB-MAPP, and editing countless  versions of this material over the past 30 years.  </p> <p> The second edition of the VB-MAPP Guide contains a number of updates and improvements. Several changes have been made to  improve the tool by clarifying the targeted skills, elaborating on the instructions, scoring process, and placement content,  adding new references, and making other adjustments designed to increase scorer reliability. Additionally, efforts have been made to help the assessor gain a better understanding of some of the conceptual and applied issues regarding the use of Skinner's (1957) analysis of verbal behavior as a guide for language assessment and intervention. There have been several changes in the milestones since the publication of the original VB-MAPP in 2008. Specifically, there are two new milestones (Social Behavior and Social Play 1M and LRFFC 9-M) and changes in 13 other milestones. A listing of the milestone changes can be found at <a href=\"http://www.avbpress.com/downloads\" target=\"_blank\">www.avbpress.com/downloads</a>. Some of these milestone changes have already been included in previous re-printings of the Protocol and Guide. In addition, 61 changes have been made in the 1 and 1/2 point scoring criteria for the milestones. Also, the instructions for the Task Analysis section include a clearer distinction between tasks that are earlier steps toward a milestone, and those that are independent of the specific milestone, but are \"supporting skills.\" The changes and improvements in the VB-MAPP are the result of feedback from the users of the system, along with a variety of field-testing activities. I thank all of those who have provided me with feedback and edits over the years, especially Dr. Rebecca Godfrey and Cindy Sundberg. </p> <p>Mark L.
