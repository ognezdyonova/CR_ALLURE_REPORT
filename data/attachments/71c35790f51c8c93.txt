Play and social skills are also important and should be a major part of the intervention, as well as increasing spontaneous vocalizations. It is important to note that there are a variety of other skills that a child may need to learn, such as fine motor, gross motor, self-help, and toileting skills, and if appropriate these should be added to the overall intervention program. The teaching style for a child scoring in Level 1 may be more of an intensive teaching format that involves a high number of teaching trials with carefully arranged contingencies (i.e., prompting, fading, careful shaping, transfer of stimulus control, use of the motivating operation (MO), differential reinforcement, etc.), and careful measurement of progress. However, for some children, a more loose teaching strategy such as natural environment training may also be effective, but the learning goals remain the same.
